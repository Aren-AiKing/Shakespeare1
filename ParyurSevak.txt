I BEG YOU
I beg you,
Do not be upset if they say
The glorious are indeed glorious,
Not humble.
The scoundrel is indeed a scoundrel,
Not noble.
The remote is indeed remote,
Not present.
I beg you,
Do not be afraid of sincere words.
Sincere words do not kill,
They only reveal closed wounds.
If you are hungry and a child—
Do not be afraid of crying.
Come on, as long as he does not cry—
They do not give a smile.
Do not be afraid
Of scraping rust from a rusty bowl.
It will not spoil from that.
Do not be afraid
Of writing the truth about falsehood.
It will diminish from that.
I beg you,
And be a little numerical,
But with this healing condition.
Do not add lies to the truth,
But divide the lie from the truth.
Do not add grief to sorrow,
But divide grief from sorrow.
And boast not with questions.
Boast only with solutions,
With the correct opening of parentheses,
With the remainder
And with the quotient...
I beg you—
Be a little psychologist too.
If a son mourns his parent's death
With a sad song,
I beg you, do not interrupt him,
What if he... does not sing well...
I beg you—
In this and similar matters,
Never ask me again...
SARDARAPAT
When there is no way out or remedy,
The madmen find a trick:
Thus arose, thus shone,
The great battle of Sardarapat.
Ringing! Echoing!
Call the sacred brave ones
From this just wall.
Generations! Know yourselves—
From Sardarapat.
From Avarayr we took effort,
Here we paused for a moment,
To breathe and give our breaths
Under the wall of Sardarapat.
Ringing! Echoing!
Call the sacred brave ones
From this just wall.
Generations! Know yourselves—
From Sardarapat.
But we did not fall; we will always stand,
We did not rest; we will still come—
When the bell rings, the alarm rings—
To give our soul's debt.
Ringing! Echoing!
Call the sacred brave ones
From this just wall.
Generations! Know yourselves—
From Sardarapat. Perhaps this was also our fate.
You, trapped in the dungeon of your remorse,
I, caught in the claws of my regret,
Walking back and forth like a prisoner
In the two syllables of your familiar name...
In the two syllables of your familiar name
Walking back and forth like a prisoner.
The fire beside me remains always cold.
The open door in front of me keeps me imprisoned,
Not trying to escape or go out... A blue sky descended upon the mountain's peak,
A mountain wave embracing the blooming shore,
A dusty little child sitting in warm earth,
A warm memory,
A well-placed caress.
Just yesterday with an unfamiliar girl
I wandered all night without fatigue,
So forgetfully, and then afterward
I would remember that day like a holiday for my entire life.
A competition won outside by your side,
A magnificent new house rising in your city,
Where in winter against the burning stove
The boy must read a captivating novel,
He who is so happy now with play...
I am terrified only now.
You say I have frozen,
I have extinguished all fires,
And now... I am groping in the darkness.
But I will say: I have walked,
When it was dark, I shone,
But I have not faltered nor do I falter.
I have not deceived with any words,
With no song or hint.
I have either loved or hated but not deceived,
I have lived two stories high,
Descended two stories down,
Gone up and down but never groped.
If I have ever groped—
I am only groping now,
If I have ever been terrified—
I am terrified only now.
Only now when I do not know—
Have you been? Are you here or not?
Only now when I feel,
Understand and tremble,
What is missing from this world without you, my lost one...
My Mother's Hands
These hands—my hands,
Ancient and new hands...
What haven’t these hands done...
How they danced at my wedding—
With what grace,
With dreams!
What haven’t these hands done...
They did not extinguish light until dawn,
When the firstborn was born,
Nourished by its righteous milk.
What haven’t these hands done...
Endured deprivation and carried burdens with silence,
With patience...
What haven’t these hands done...
They have become columns raised to heaven,
So that the pillar of their house does not fall—
The son returns home from battle.
What haven’t these hands done...
Until they became grandmother's hands,
These hands—having lost strength,
But finding new strength with the grandson...
They have turned stones and moved mountains...
What more can be said about these hands—
Tender hands,
Holy hands:
Let us today kiss them as sons—
Those who gave us birth in this world, nurtured us,
Those who won and protected us in this world—
Who never grew tired of us—
Dust-cleaning, washing away,
Endlessly judging and endlessly speaking—
These hands:
Though cracked and hardened—
For us they are like silk—
These precious hands...
Excessive Disbelief
In your name, Maryam,
In your name—
Winter retreats rapidly here:
Summer without waiting—
Even before spring—
Lives on thanks to your name...
And here is someone by your name.
And I swear to you by your name
That I hate a little
And love just as much
This foreign girl by your name.
How does she live by your name?
She is not you; is she by your name?
Thus I hate a little
And love just as much
This foreign girl by your name.
I call her by your name
And torment myself by your name;
But she understands nothing from my torment.
So contradictory is it by your name!
But I call her by your name;
I call her as people used to call spirits kindly...
Your spirit does not appear by your name!
Then is there really none in our world?
And is there no spirit at all...?
I am once again becoming a bad believer—by your name!
AT ONCE
They say that nothing happens at once in life.
At once no carpet or rug tears apart;
At once a fortress is neither built nor demolished;
At once snow does not fall nor does even the wind blow.
A fruit does not ripen at once; where did wisdom go?
They do not form a pair at once; where did three go?
They do not get full at once nor feel thirsty;
Neither today becomes past nor tomorrow becomes future.
All this is true indeed; it is just as it is.
However if they were to ask me at least once in my life:
What do I prefer?
And dream?
I would say: Whatever happens—let it happen at once...
WE ARE FEW BUT WE ARE ARMENIAN
We are few but we call ourselves Armenian.
We do not prefer ourselves over anyone else.
Simply we must accept that we alone possess Ararat
And that here above Lake Sevan
The sky reflects its true image.
Simply David fought here.
Simply Narek wrote here.
Simply we know how to carve monasteries from rock
Build fish and birds from clay for teaching purposes
And to educate beauty!
Goodness!
Sublimity!
We are few but we call ourselves Armenian.
We do not prefer ourselves over anyone else.
Simply our fate has been different;
Simply we have shed much blood.
Simply throughout our long life
When we were many
And stood firm
We never oppressed another nation;
No one has suffered from our hand's strike.
If we conquered—
Only through our books.
If we ruled—
Only through our talents.
Simply death has fallen in love with us;
Yet we willingly did not surrender to it.
And when we were left without land—
Wherever we reached or wherever we were
We worked for everyone’s sake:
Built bridges
Connected arches;
Plowed everywhere;
Harvested crops;
Gave everyone a rich harvest of songs:
Protected them from spiritual coldness;
Left reflections from our eyes everywhere:
From our soul—a relic
And from our heart—a fragment... We are few yes but we are called Armenian—
We still know how to groan from unhealed wounds
But rejoice and be merry with new joy!
We know how to pierce the enemy’s side
And become allies for friends!
Come out from under kindness done to us—
Repaying one with ten times more
In favor of the righteous and the sun!
We know how to vote with our lives too!
But if they want to burn us forcibly—
We know how to fight back—and extinguish fire!
And if it is necessary to disperse darkness—
We know how to turn into ashes like bright candles!
And we also know how to love passionately
But always respecting others!
We do not prefer ourselves over anyone else
But we also know ourselves—we are called Armenian!
And why should we not be proud?
We exist! We must be! And still—we must grow!
